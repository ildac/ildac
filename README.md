## How to communicate with Me...
#### The best way to communicate with me is:
- Important/urgent things, face to face, (video, in person) let's talk directly. It avoids misunderstandings and oversights
- Other info, message me, mail, write somewhere, async coms are prefectly fine for this (usually I will answer in 24h)

#### The best type of meeting for me is:
- Agenda is clear and shared
- Starts on time (ok 2/3 minutes of academic time is ok!)
- Relevant people is there, and meeting is not too crowded
- Clear outcome and actions at the end of the meeting

#### The best way to solve a problem with me is:
- Be kind, but direct, just jump on a call and let's talk about it
